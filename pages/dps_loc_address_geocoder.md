# BC ADDRESS GEOCODER

The BC Address Geocoder is a REST web service that can be used to resolve the physical locations (i.e., latitude and longitude) and correct, standardized form of civic and non-civic addresses in British Columbia.

For more information on this service see the [BC Address Geocoder website](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=118DD57CD9674D57BDBD511C2E78DC0D). There are also some BC Address Geocoder [Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/bcgov/ols-geocoder/blob/gh-pages/faq.md).

Ministry and Broader Public Sector (BPS) can contribute their own data through by publishing data to the [BC Geographic Warehouse](dsg_before_you_start.md):
+ [The Geographic Sites Registry (GSR)](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/d5c6b8ed-c272-4c9e-8813-590a47b5c01c) - once published in this set of data, the locations automatically get used in the Geocoder.

If you have questions about accessing the geocoder or using the BC Address Geocoder, please [open a ticket with the Data Systems & Services request system](https://dpdd.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/group/7/create/15).
