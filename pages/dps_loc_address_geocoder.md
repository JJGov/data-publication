# BC ADDRESS GEOCODER

The BC Address Geocoder is a REST web service that can be used to resolve the physical locations (i.e., latitude and longitude) and correct, standardized form of civic and non-civic addresses in British Columbia.

For more information about this service see the [BC Address Geocoder webpage](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=118DD57CD9674D57BDBD511C2E78DC0D).

The BC Address Geocoder service can be used to resolve the physical locations (i.e., latitude and longitude) and correct, standardized form of civic and non-civic addresses in British Columbia. Access to the service is through: 
1. The REST API: see the [BC Address Geocoder Developer Guide](https://github.com/bcgov/ols-geocoder/blob/gh-pages/geocoder-developer-guide.md)
2. Batch Geocoding: 
   - [Geocoder Address List Editor](https://bcgov.github.io/ols-devkit/ale/) (for up to 1000 addresses)
   - [Batch Geocoder (Restricted Access)](https://apps.gov.bc.ca/pub/cpf/secure/ws/apps/geocoder/) for large address lists

If you have questions about accessing the geocoder service, please [open a ticket with the Data Systems & Services request system](https://dpdd.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/group/7/create/15).

 

Ministry and Broader Public Sector (BPS) can contribute their own data for the geocoder to reference by publishing location data to the [BC Geographic Warehouse](dsg_before_you_start.md): i.e., the [Geographic Sites Registry (GSR)](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/d5c6b8ed-c272-4c9e-8813-590a47b5c01c) - once published in this set of data, the locations automatically get used in the Geocoder.
