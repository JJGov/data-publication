# BC ADDRESS GEOCODER

The BC Address Geocoder is a REST web service that can be used to resolve the physical locations (i.e., latitude and longitude) and correct, standardized form of civic and non-civic addresses in British Columbia.

For more information on this service see the [BC Address Geocoder website](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=118DD57CD9674D57BDBD511C2E78DC0D).

Ministry and Broader Public Sector (BPS) can contribute their own data through by publishing data to the [BC Geographic Warehouse](dsg_before_you_start.md):
1. The Geographic Sites Registry (GSR) - once published in this set of data, it automatically gets used in the Geocoder.
2. Organization boundaries can be used by the Geocoder, which requires an engagement with the Location Services team which reached by emailing [Data@gov.bc.ca](mailto:Data@gov.bc.ca).

B.C. local governments interested in contributing their address data for use in the BC Address Geocoder are encouraged to contact DataBC at [Data@gov.bc.ca](mailto:Data@gov.bc.ca).
