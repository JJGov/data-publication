## HOW TO BECOME A PROVIDER TO THE CATALOGUE

To become a Catalogue editor/publisher for a Sub-Organization (a Branch or Division), approval from the Data Custodian (Director or Executive Director) is required. Here are the steps to complete this, provide:

1. Approval from the Data Custodian to publish and manage records and data on their behalf.
3. The name of the Ministry/Organization and Sub-Organization (as it appears in the Catalogue and if that needs to be renamed) in your email. 
4. All names and IDIRs for those requiring access.
5. Forward all this to [DataBC](mailto:Data@gov.bc.ca) with the subject: "BCDC Editor Request". 
6. A Catalogue administrator will then add you as an editor to the Sub-Org and contact you with all relevant information to get you started as an Editor in the BC Data Catalogue.

Organizations in the Broader Public Sector (BPS) may publish metadata records and data to the Catalogue. 
+ For datasets licensed under Open Data, these organizations will require their own Open Government Licence. See [Licences](./dps_licences.md) page for more information on this.  
+ Contact [DataBC.DA](mailto:DataBC.DA@gov.bc.ca) to discuss publishing and cataloguing your data, application or service to the Catalogue.
